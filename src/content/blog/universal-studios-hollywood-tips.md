Universal Studios is amazing, but the lines can be brutal.

## 1. Use the Single Rider Line
This is the golden rule. Rides like *Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey* and *Jurassic World* have Single Rider lines. You can often cut a 90-minute wait down to 15 minutes if you don't mind sitting apart from your group.

## 2. Super Nintendo World Strategy
*   **Early Access:** If you are a huge Mario fan, buy the "Early Access Ticket" ($20 extra) to enter the land 1 hour before the park opens.
*   **Reservations:** On busy days, you need a "Virtual Line" reservation just to enter the land. Check the app as soon as you arrive.

## 3. The Studio Tour Timing
The world-famous Studio Tour takes 60 minutes.
*   **Best Time:** Do this between 12 PM and 2 PM when the sun is hottest and ride lines are longest. It’s a great way to rest your legs.

## 4. Buy Tickets Online
Never buy tickets at the gate. Online tickets are usually $10-$20 cheaper, and you can sometimes get "Buy a Day, Get a 2nd Day Free" deals.
