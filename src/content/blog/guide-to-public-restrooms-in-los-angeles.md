Let's be honest: finding a public restroom in Los Angeles can be harder than spotting a celebrity. Unlike Europe, you rarely pay to use them, but finding one unlocked is the challenge.

## 1. The "Code on Receipt" Rule
Most Starbucks, McDonald's, and fast-food chains in tourist areas (especially Hollywood Blvd) lock their restrooms.
*   **The Hack:** Buy the cheapest item (usually a bottle of water or a cookie) to get the code printed on the receipt.

## 2. Best Free Options (No Purchase Necessary)
*   **Santa Monica Place:** The dining deck on the top floor has excellent, clean facilities.
*   **The Grove (Fairfax):** High-quality restrooms near the concierge desk.
*   **Ovation Hollywood (formerly Hollywood & Highland):** The massive mall next to the Chinese Theatre has public restrooms on multiple levels.
*   **Target / Whole Foods:** Large grocery stores almost always have unlocked restrooms.

## 3. The Beach Situation
*   **Santa Monica & Venice:** There are concrete restroom blocks every few hundred yards along the bike path. They are basic, often sandy, and sometimes lack toilet paper. Bring your own tissues!

## 4. Hotel Lobbies
If you are dressed neatly, you can often use the lobby restrooms of large hotels (like the Westin Bonaventure in DTLA) without being questioned. Walk with confidence.
