The myth that "nobody walks in LA" is changing. With the expanding Metro system, you can visit many tourist spots without a rental car.

## The TAP Card
Buy a TAP card at any station ($2).
*   **Fare:** $1.75 per ride.
*   **Cap:** You never pay more than $5 per day, no matter how many rides you take.

## Key Lines for Tourists
1.  **E Line (Expo):** Connects **Downtown LA** to **Santa Monica**. It takes about 45 mins but beats rush hour traffic.
2.  **B Line (Red):** Connects **Union Station**, **Downtown**, **Hollywood**, and **Universal Studios**. This is the most useful line for sightseeing.
3.  **K Line:** The newest line connecting near the airport (LAX) to Inglewood (SoFi Stadium).

## Safety Tips
*   Metro trains are generally safe during the day, but can feel uneasy at night.
*   Always stay in cars with other people.
*   Homelessness is visible on the trains; usually, people keep to themselves, but stay alert.
