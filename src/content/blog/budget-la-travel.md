LA is expensive, but you don't have to break the bank.

## 1. Eat Street Food
Don't just eat at restaurants. LA has the best taco trucks in the US.
*   **Leo's Tacos Truck:** Famous for Al Pastor ($2-3 per taco).
*   **Grand Central Market:** A food hall with affordable options.

## 2. Free Museums
Many world-class museums are free:
*   **The Getty Center:** Free admission (just pay $20 parking, or take Uber).
*   **Griffith Observatory:** Free entry to the building and telescopes.
*   **The Broad:** Free contemporary art (reserve tickets in advance).

## 3. Use the TAP Card
Uber adds up fast. Buy a TAP card ($2) and load it. A ride on Metro Bus or Rail is only $1.75, with free transfers for 2 hours.
