Just 30 minutes north of Santa Monica lies Malibu, 27 miles of scenic beauty.

## The Drive: PCH
Driving the **Pacific Coast Highway (PCH)** is an experience in itself. With cliffs on one side and the ocean on the other, it's breathtaking.

## Stop 1: The Getty Villa
Start your morning here. It's a recreation of an ancient Roman country house filled with Greek and Roman art.
*   *Note:* Admission is free, but you must book a time slot online in advance. Parking is $20.

## Stop 2: Malibu Pier
A great spot for lunch. **Malibu Farm** at the end of the pier offers organic food with stunning views. It's pricey but worth it for the atmosphere.

## Stop 3: El Matador State Beach
This is the most photogenic beach in LA. Huge rock formations rise out of the sand.
*   *Tip:* The parking lot is tiny. Arrive early or be prepared to wait.

## Stop 4: Point Dume
Drive up the hill to Point Dume Nature Preserve. If you are lucky, you might spot migrating whales from the cliffs!
