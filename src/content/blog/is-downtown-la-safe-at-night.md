Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA) is a tale of two cities. One street has luxury high-rises, and the next has tent cities. Here is how to navigate it safely.

## The Rule of Precincts
DTLA is not one uniform blob. It is divided into districts.

### ✅ Safe(r) Zones
*   **South Park (near Crypto.com Arena):** Very safe, clean, patrolled by private security.
*   **Bunker Hill / Grand Ave:** Where the Disney Hall and The Broad museum are. Generally safe and quiet at night.
*   **Arts District:** Hip, trendy, full of breweries. Safe, but walking *to* it can be sketchy.

### ❌ The Danger Zone: Skid Row
You must look at a map before you book your hotel.
*   **Boundaries:** Roughly East of Main St, South of 3rd St, North of 7th St.
*   **Advice:** Do not walk here. Even in a car, keep doors locked. It is the epicenter of the homeless crisis.

## The "After 10 PM" Rule
Unlike NYC or London, DTLA empties out after business hours (except for South Park).
*   **Transport:** Do not wait for a bus alone on a dark corner after 10 PM. Use Uber or Lyft to go door-to-door.
*   **Metro:** The Red/Purple line stations (Pershing Square, Civic Center) can feel intimidating late at night. Stick to the well-lit entrances.
