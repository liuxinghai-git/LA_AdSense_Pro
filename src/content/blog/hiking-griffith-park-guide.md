Griffith Park is one of the largest urban parks in North America.

## 1. The Easy Walk: Ferndell Nature Trail
Located near the bottom of the park, this is a tropical oasis with ferns, streams, and shade. It leads up to The Trails Cafe, where you can grab coffee and avocado toast.

## 2. The Classic: Mt. Hollywood Trail
Start at the Griffith Observatory parking lot.
*   **Difficulty:** Moderate.
*   **Views:** You get a 360-degree view of the LA Basin and a great side-view of the Hollywood Sign.

## 3. The Hollywood Sign Hike: Canyon Drive
If you want to get *behind* the letters.
*   Start at **Canyon Drive**.
*   Hike up to the **Typhoon Canyon**.
*   This trail takes about 2-3 hours round trip and takes you directly behind the massive H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D letters.

**Warning:** Bring water. There is very little shade in the park and it gets hot.
