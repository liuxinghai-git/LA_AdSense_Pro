Los Angeles has the best Mexican food outside of Mexico. Tacos are a religion here.

## 1. Leo's Tacos Truck
*   **Location:** La Brea Ave & Venice Blvd (Gas Station).
*   **The Order:** Al Pastor Tacos. Watch them slice the pork from the spinning trompo and flick a piece of pineapple on top. $2 each. Cash only.

## 2. Guisados
*   **Location:** Echo Park, DTLA, West Hollywood.
*   **The Order:** The Sampler Platter. You get 6 mini tacos with different braised meats (stews). The handmade tortillas are thick and soft.

## 3. Sonoratown
*   **Location:** Downtown LA.
*   **The Order:** Chivichangas. Northern Mexico style flour tortillas that are award-winning.

## 4. Teddy's Red Tacos
*   **Location:** Venice Beach.
*   **The Order:** Birria Tacos with Consommé. Dip the crispy, beef-filled taco into the red soup. It's messy and delicious.
