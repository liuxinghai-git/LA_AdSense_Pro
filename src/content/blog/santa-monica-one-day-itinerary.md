Santa Monica is the quintessential California dream. Here is how to spend a perfect day here.

## Morning: Coffee and Bikes
Start at **Dogtown Coffee** for a breakfast burrito. Then, rent a bike near the pier.
*   **Activity:** Ride the Marvin Braude Bike Trail south towards Venice Beach (about 20 mins). It’s flat, scenic, and iconic.

## Lunch: The Pier
Head back to the **Santa Monica Pier**.
*   Walk to the very end to see the fishermen.
*   Take a photo with the "End of Route 66" sign.
*   **Lunch:** Grab a burger at *Pier Burger* or seafood at *The Albright*.

## Afternoon: Shopping
Walk up Colorado Ave to **Santa Monica Place** and the **3rd Street Promenade**.
*   This open-air mall features street performers and great shopping.
*   **Hidden Gem:** Palisades Park. It’s a strip of grass on the cliffs overlooking the ocean. Perfect for relaxing.

## Evening: Sunset
Watch the sunset from the beach (left side of the pier).
*   **Dinner:** For a splurge, try *The Lobster*. For budget, head to *Tacos Por Favor*.
