People say New York drivers are aggressive. They are wrong. New York drivers are assertive. Los Angeles drivers are fast, distracted, and completely unpredictable.

If you are renting a car for your trip, I am not trying to scare you. Okay, maybe I am trying to scare you a little bit. Because if you treat driving here like a leisurely Sunday cruise, you are going to get honked at, or worse, end up with a $90 parking ticket.

Here is what you need to know before you turn the key in the ignition.

## The "Right on Red" Rule
In California, you can turn right on a red light (unless a sign says otherwise).
Locals do not stop for this. We do a "California Roll." We slow down, look left, and go.
If you come to a complete stop for 5 seconds at a red light when it's clear to turn, the person behind you will lose their mind. Keep the flow moving.

## The Parking Sign IQ Test
Parking signs in LA are designed to break your spirit. You will see a pole with five different signs on it.
*   *Sign 1:* No Parking 7 AM - 9 AM.
*   *Sign 2:* 2 Hour Parking 9 AM - 6 PM.
*   *Sign 3:* Permit Only 6 PM - Midnight.
*   *Sign 4:* Street Sweeping Tuesday.

**My Advice:** Read it top to bottom. Then read it bottom to top. If you are 90% sure it's okay, it's probably not. Look at the curb. Red means no. Yellow means loading zone (commercial only). White means loading passengers. If the curb is unpainted, you still might be wrong. When in doubt, pay for a garage. A $20 garage fee is cheaper than a $75 ticket.

## The Freeway Merge of Death
Merging onto the 110 Freeway (especially the historic Arroyo Seco part) is not for the faint of heart. The on-ramps are about 10 feet long. You have to go from 0 to 60 mph in two seconds flat.
**Do not hesitate.** If you stop at the end of the on-ramp waiting for a "safe opening," you will never get in. You have to be aggressive. Signal, accelerate, and pray.

## Distance vs. Time
In LA, we never talk about miles. We talk about minutes.
"How far is Santa Monica?"
"It's 45 minutes."
"But it's only 10 miles away?"
"Did I stutter? It's 45 minutes."

If you check Google Maps at 10 AM and it says a drive is 20 minutes, assume that at 5 PM it will be an hour. Never schedule dinner reservations tightly.

## The Gas Station Bathroom Code
If you are driving and need a restroom, do not assume the gas station has one open. If they do, it almost certainly has a keypad lock.
**Pro tip:** Buy a pack of gum. The code is usually printed on the bottom of the receipt. If you just ask the attendant, they will often lie and say "it's out of order" because they don't want to clean it.

Driving here is a battle, but it's also the only way to see the real city. Just turn up the music, put on a podcast, and accept your fate in the traffic jam. It's part of the authentic experience.
