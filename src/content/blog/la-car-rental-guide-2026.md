Los Angeles is famous for its car culture. While public transport is improving, renting a car is still the best way to see the city efficiently. Here is your survival guide.

## 1. Do You Actually Need a Car?
*   **YES** if: You plan to visit Malibu, Disneyland, hike in Griffith Park, or explore different neighborhoods in one day.
*   **NO** if: You are only staying in Downtown LA or Santa Monica and plan to use Uber for short trips.

## 2. Where to Rent: Airport vs. Off-Site
Most people rent at LAX.
*   **Pro Tip:** LAX rental lots are not *at* the terminal. You must take a shuttle.
*   **Money Hack:** Sometimes renting from a location *outside* the airport (like in Culver City or Inglewood) is 30% cheaper. Check Uber costs to get there vs. the savings.

## 3. Insurance: Don't Get Scammed
Rental agents will try to sell you expensive insurance.
*   Check if your credit card covers **CDW (Collision Damage Waiver)**.
*   If you are from overseas, buying full coverage online (via platforms like Rentalcars or Booking) is usually cheaper than at the counter.

## 4. Navigating LA Traffic
*   **The 405 Freeway:** Avoid it between 4 PM and 7 PM. It is a parking lot.
*   **Car pool Lanes (HOV):** You can use these if you have 2+ people in the car.
*   **Parking Apps:** Use apps like *SpotHero* to find cheap parking garages. Street parking signs in LA are notoriously confusing—read them twice!
