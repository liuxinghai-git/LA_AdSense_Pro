The 2026 FIFA World Cup is coming to North America, and Los Angeles is set to be one of the premier host cities. If you are planning to visit LA for the matches, early preparation is key.

## SoFi Stadium: The Crown Jewel
Matches will be held at the state-of-the-art **SoFi Stadium** in Inglewood. This venue is a marvel of modern engineering, featuring an open-air design with a translucent roof.

### Key Facts for Fans:
*   **Capacity:** 70,000+ seats.
*   **Location:** Inglewood, about 3 miles from LAX Airport.
*   **Climate:** The stadium is covered, but open on the sides. Dress in layers.

## Accommodation Strategy
Hotel prices will skyrocket. We recommend three main areas:
1.  **LAX Area:** Most convenient for the stadium. Prices are reasonable if booked early.
2.  **Santa Monica:** If you want a vacation vibe with beach access. It's connected by Metro (E Line) but requires a transfer to a shuttle.
3.  **Downtown LA (DTLA):** Good public transport links, but be careful with safety at night.

## Getting Tickets
Official ticket sales have not started yet. Sign up on the official FIFA website for alerts. Do not buy from unauthorized scalpers as digital tickets are strictly controlled.

## Transport
Do NOT rent a car just to drive to the stadium. Parking will be hundreds of dollars. Use the dedicated **World Cup Shuttles** that will run from major Metro stations like *Hawthorne/Lennox*.
