Los Angeles is generally safe for tourists, but its urban sprawl means safe neighborhoods and dangerous ones are often just blocks apart.

## The "No-Go" Zones
Every tourist must know about **Skid Row**.
*   **Where is it?** Downtown LA (DTLA), roughly bordered by 3rd St, 7th St, Alameda St, and Main St.
*   **What to expect?** Thousands of homeless encampments. It is unpredictable and unsafe for walking, even during the day.
*   **Advice:** If you stay in DTLA, stick to the Financial District and Bunker Hill.

## Car Safety: Smash and Grab
This is the #1 crime affecting tourists.
*   **The Rule:** NEVER leave anything visible in your car.
*   **Not even a charging cable.**
*   **Not even a jacket.**
*   If thieves see a bag, they break the window. Put everything in the trunk *before* you arrive at your parking spot.

## Nighttime Safety
Hollywood Blvd is famous, but it gets gritty after 10 PM. Santa Monica Pier is safe, but the parks nearby can be sketchy at night. Stick to well-lit areas with crowds.
