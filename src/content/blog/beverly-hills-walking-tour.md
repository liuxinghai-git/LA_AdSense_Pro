You don't have to be a millionaire to enjoy Beverly Hills. It is one of the most beautiful neighborhoods for walking.

## Stop 1: The Beverly Hills Sign
Start at **Beverly Gardens Park**. Take a photo with the famous lily pond and the Beverly Hills sign.

## Stop 2: Rodeo Drive
Walk south down Rodeo Drive.
*   Window shop at Gucci, Prada, and Bijan (the most expensive store in the world).
*   Look out for supercars parked on the street.
*   Walk through **Two Rodeo**, a cobblestone street that looks like Europe.

## Stop 3: The Beverly Wilshire Hotel
At the end of Rodeo Drive stands this historic hotel, famous from the movie *Pretty Woman*. Walk into the lobby to see the flowers—it smells like money.

## Stop 4: Sprinkles Cupcake ATM
Walk a few blocks to Santa Monica Blvd. There is a pink ATM that dispenses fresh cupcakes 24/7. It's a fun photo op and a sweet treat ($5).
