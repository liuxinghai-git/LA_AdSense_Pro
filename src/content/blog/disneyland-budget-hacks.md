A trip to the "Happiest Place on Earth" comes with a hefty price tag. Here is how to lower the cost.

## 1. Ticket Strategies
*   **Avoid Weekends:** Tier 0 tickets (weekdays in off-season) are significantly cheaper than Tier 6 (holidays).
*   **One Park Per Day:** Park Hopper tickets add $60+ per person. Stick to one park (Disneyland Park or California Adventure) per day to save.

## 2. Stay in Anaheim, Not a Disney Hotel
Disney's own hotels (Grand Californian) cost $700+/night.
*   **Alternative:** Stay at "Good Neighbor Hotels" on Harbor Blvd. They are a 10-minute walk to the gate and cost $150-$200.

## 3. Bring Your Own Food
Unlike many parks, Disney allows you to bring outside food.
*   Pack sandwiches, snacks, and refillable water bottles.
*   There are water refill stations everywhere.
*   **Budget Treat:** Get the famous Dole Whip ($7) instead of a sit-down meal.

## 4. Genie+: Is it Worth It?
Disney's paid line-skipping service (Genie+) costs $25+ per day.
*   **Verdict:** Only buy it if you have limited time (1 day only). If you have 2-3 days, you can manage without it by using "Rope Drop" (arriving 30 mins before opening).
