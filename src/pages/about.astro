        <h1 class="text-4xl font-black mb-8">Why "101"?</h1>

            <p>
                In American universities, the introductory course is always numbered "101". Math 101. History 101. It means "The Basics." It means "Start Here."
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, the 101 Freeway is the vein that connects our city, from the valley to downtown.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is why we are <strong>LA Hotels 101</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We noticed a problem. Most travel websites are rewritten press releases. They tell you every hotel is "luxurious" and "convenient." We live here. We know that "convenient to the beach" sometimes means "a 45-minute bus ride."
            </p>
            <p>
                We built this site to be the <strong>School of Hard Knocks</strong> for LA visitors. We want to teach you the basics that no one else tells you.
